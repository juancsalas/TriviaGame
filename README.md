# TriviaGame - Juan Carlos Salas
Assignment 5

This is a 20 question trivia game with a theme from the TV show "Parks and Recreation"

When the page loads, you'll see the TV Show logo, a start button and with a snippet of the theme song automatically playing. Clicking the start button will start the trivia and stop the audio.

Each question is displayed one at a time with four possible answers and a countdown clock of 10 seconds. When you answer a question or run out of time, the program will display an answer page either confirming your choice to be correct, or informing you of the correct if it's not chosen. You will also see a picture of GIF related to the question and some information below the image, before automatically moving on to the next question.

As you progress through the trivia game, your correct, incorrect, and unanswered results will be recorded in the background, and displayed to you after you are done answering the last question. Depending on the amount of questions you answer correctly, the image and message in the results page will change. You will also see your game states and a restart button that starts the trivia all over again.
