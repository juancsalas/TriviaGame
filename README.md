# TriviaGame - Juan Carlos Salas

### About the App
This is a 20 question trivia game with a theme from the TV show "Parks and Recreation"

When the page loads, you'll see the TV Show logo, a start button and with a snippet of the theme song automatically playing. Clicking the start button will start the trivia and stop the audio.

Each question is displayed one at a time with four possible answers and a countdown clock of 10 seconds. When you answer a question or run out of time, the program will display an answer page either confirming your choice to be correct, or informing you of the correct if it's not chosen. You will also see a picture of GIF related to the question and some information below the image, before automatically moving on to the next question.

As you progress through the trivia game, the app will keep track of your correct, incorrect, and unanswered results, and will be displayed to you after you are finished with all the questions. Depending on the amount of questions you answer correctly, the image and message in the results page will change. You will also see your game states and a restart button that starts the trivia all over again.

### Development
I took about a week to build this game and mostly used [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/) and [JQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) for the functionality aspect. I utilized [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) and my own CSS for the design and layout.

### Deployment
The app was deployed through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and you can check it out here: [Trivia Game: Parks and Rec Edition](https://juancsalas.github.io/TriviaGame/)
